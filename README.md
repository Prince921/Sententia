# Sententia

Sententia is making an Off-chain vote counting system reliable and trustworthy without having any third party acting as a central point of failure.

Users generate a Proof of Vote for the options voted. The count of the Proof of Votes will lead to transparent and back trackable calculations of the final results. The Proof of Votes will be encrypted, with only voters having the power to decrypt it. The third party will fail to tamper with the votes, and hence the results in an off-chain voting system.

Smooth, third-party free conducting of off-chain voting will be done.
